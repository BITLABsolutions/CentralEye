(d) description of the client requirements

There is a complete database on academic staff (about  160 )But the data is sotred as Excell sheets and They find it dificult to query those data when it needed.

They face a huge challenge designing the timetable for teachers every once a year because of the complexity of the data.

Students face many difficulties when they need to get the character certificate while leaving the school.
Currently they have a record book to keep record of their academic and extra curricular activities. but, there are also lots of problems with that bookkeeping system. Some students damage or lost their record book. Some doesn't update it constantly. And the worst fact is that sometimes it is not 100% trustworthy.

Some students neglect to return the books they borrowed from the library in time. But they have to return the book and fines when they are getting the leaving certificate. But there should be a mechanism to collect those ..... books not .... until they are leaving the school.

To improve the quality of the staff, there should be a way to give them open feedback which those teachers and the principals only can view.

The school web site need to be updated realtime about the activities by the clubs, sports societies etc.. So it would be very convenient if a reprecentative of each clubs and societies could feed the web site like a social web site. ( a decentralized system with responcible and quick data entry )
